AcaVis
======

This software is the (practical) result of the concept presented in my bachelor-thesis in september 2014.
It's important to know that this application has a prototypical character at the moment.
It's licensed as Open-Source under GNU GPL v2 and is free to use and modify under the same conditions.

Some of the features presented in the concept are not fully implemented yet so this software will grow
and develop in the future according to my free-time.


*****
Usage-Instructions
***

Due to the unfinished and prototypical character no deployment to a ready-to-use package-file was made yet.
All dependencies and libraries are managed via Maven. The corresponding `pom.xml` is included. In order to
build the application all depedencies have to be grabbed and resolved by Maven first.
To use AcaVis, the project should be imported to an IDE and started from there.
I am using the following setup at the moment which should work fine for this case:

- Oracle Java 7
- Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers (Luna - Version 4.4)
- Maven 2 Eclipse (Usually included)
- Spring IDE (Eclipse-Integration)
- Apache Tomcat 7 Webserver

A detailed instruction to import and use this project with the mentioned setup will follow.
